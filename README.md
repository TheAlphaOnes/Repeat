# Repeat
zen workspace for you to study and work

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind "repeat" was to combat distractions while studying online. The allure and ease of the internet often lead to distractions, so the team wanted to create a tool that would help users stay focused and stick to their study schedule.

## What it does
- **Distraction Prevention**: "repeat" prevents users from leaving their study session by restricting access to other apps and allowing them to focus solely on a specific webpage for a set period.
- **Note-taking and Flashcards**: The tool assists users in writing notes and creating flashcards to aid in memorization. It also facilitates the creation of question-answer formats for easier revision.
- **AI Integration**: "repeat" integrates AI features such as Gemini AI to help users answer questions and a surveillance AI bot that uses webcam footage to monitor for distractions and remind users to focus on their studies.
- **Study Tracker**: The tool includes a study tracker that awards points for every minute spent studying, providing users with a sense of accomplishment and progress.

## How I built it
- **Technologies Used**: The team utilized Electron for the desktop app, React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and integrated Gemini AI through APIs.
- **Challenges Faced**: Challenges included integrating Electron with React, integrating Gemini AI with notes, managing time effectively, and designing a complex system.
- **Proud Accomplishments**: Despite not completing the project entirely, the team is proud of their dedication and effort in coding until the last minute.

## Challenges I ran into
- **Management and System Design**: The project taught the team valuable lessons in project management and real-world system design.
- **Handling Stress**: Dealing with stress during the development process taught the team how to manage stress effectively and adapt their mindset.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Even though we didn't quite finish everything we set out to do, we're super proud of the effort we put in. Coding until the very end taught us a lot â€“ not just about tech, but also about teamwork, stress management, and the power of perseverance.

## What I learned
Through building "repeat," I learned the power of effective time management, the importance of resilience in the face of challenges, and the value of teamwork and collaboration. Most importantly, I discovered that failure is just a stepping stone to success, and the journey itself is often the most rewarding part.

## What's next for repeat
- **Open Sourcing**: The team plans to continue working on "repeat" beyond the hackathon and eventually open-source the project for the benefit of future generations.
