**Nutrients**

Nutrients are essential substances that the body needs to function properly. They provide energy, build and repair tissues, and regulate bodily functions. The three main categories of nutrients are:

* **Macronutrients:** These provide energy and building materials for the body. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
* **Micronutrients:** These are needed in smaller amounts than macronutrients and are involved in a variety of bodily functions. They include vitamins and minerals.
* **Water:** Water is essential for all bodily functions and makes up about 60% of the human body.
